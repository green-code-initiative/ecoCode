With a call to `LocationManager#requestLocationUpdates(String provider, long minTime, float minDistance, LocationListener listener)`, the location provider will only send your application an update when the location has changed by at least minDistance meters AND at least minTime milliseconds have passed. So `minTime` should be the primary tool to conserve battery life, and, to a lesser extent, `minDistance`.

These two must imperatively be greater than 0.

== Compliant Code Example

[source,java]
----
locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER,
    60000L,  // refresh location at least each 60000ms
    10.0f,   // refresh location at least each 10 meters
    this);
