An app holding the permission `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` asks the user to allow it to ignore battery optimizations (that is, put them on the whitelist of apps).

Most applications should not use this; there are many facilities provided by the platform for applications to operate correctly in the various power saving modes.
