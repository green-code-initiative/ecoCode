== Why is this an issue?

Animations play a crucial role in creating a dynamic and engaging user interface in iOS applications. Both UIKit and SwiftUI provide powerful tools to create smooth and appealing animations. Developers need to be familiar with various methods and properties to implement animations effectively.

To ensure animations are used effectively without draining the device's battery, it's important to check for unnecessary animations and optimize them. This can be done by reviewing the use of functions like `withAnimation(::)`, the `animation(_:value:)` view modifier, and the bindingâ€™s `animation(_:)` method in SwiftUI, as well as checking the use of UIKit's animation methods.

== How to fix it in UIKit
=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
// Noncompliant
UIView.animate(withDuration:animations:)
UIView.animate(withDuration:animations:completion:)
UIView.animate(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)
UIView.animateKeyframes(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)
UIView.transition(with:duration:options:animations:completion:)
CABasicAnimation
CAKeyframeAnimation
CATransition
----

=== Compliant solution

Avoid animations.

== How to fix it in SwiftUI
=== Noncompliant code example

[source,swift]
----
// Noncompliant
withAnimation
Animation
AnyTransition
.animation(Animation?)
.transition(AnyTransition)
.onAppear(perform:)
.onDisappear(perform:)
----

=== Compliant solution

Avoid animations.
