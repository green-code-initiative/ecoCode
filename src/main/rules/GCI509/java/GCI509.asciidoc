Applications are strongly discouraged from using exact alarms unnecessarily as they reduce the OS's ability to minimize battery use (i.e. Doze Mode).

For most apps prior to API 19, `setInexactRepeating()` is preferable over `setRepeating()`. When you use this method, Android synchronizes multiple inexact repeating alarms and fires them at the same time, thus reducing the battery drain.

Similarly after API 19, `setExact()` and `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()` can significantly impact the power use of the device when idle, so they should be used with care. High-frequency alarms are also bad for battery life but this is already checked by Android lint (ShortAlarm built-in check).
