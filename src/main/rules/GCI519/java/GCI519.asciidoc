It's always good that an app has different behavior when device is connected/disconnected to a power station, or has different battery levels.

One can monitor the changes in charging state with a broadcast receiver registered on the actions `ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED` and `ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED`, or monitor significant changes in battery level with a broadcast receiver registered on the actions `BATTERY_LOW` and `BATTERY_OKAY`.
