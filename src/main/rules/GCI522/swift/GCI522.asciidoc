To avoid draining the battery, an iOS device adapt its brightness to the environment .

Hence, keeping forcing the screen brightness on should be avoided, unless it is absolutely necessary. If so, developers typically force the Brightness to 1 with `UIScreen.main.brightness = a float`.

== Non compliant Code Example

[source,swift]
----
UIScreen.main.brightness = CGFloat(0.3)
