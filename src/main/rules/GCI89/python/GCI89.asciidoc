Python doesn't have TTL on cache with default libraries.

With functools library @cache acts the same way than @lru_cache(maxsize=None).
@lru_cache(maxsize=None) create an unlimited cache and must be a source of memory leak, an unlimited cache can take a lot of RAM / Disk space, resulting to a big energy consumption.

By default, lru_cache set the size of cache to 128 entries.

In this case, the cache is unlimited which is suspect.

== Non compliant Code Examples

[source,python]
----
 @cache # Noncompliant
 def cached_function():
   ...
----

[source,python]
----
 @lru_cache(maxsize=None) # Noncompliant
 def cached_function():
   ...
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,python]
----
 @lru_cache() # By default, the max size of the cache is 128
 def cached_function():
    ...
----

[source,python]
----
 @lru_cache(maxsize=16) # Define a max size to the cache
 def cached_function():
    ...
