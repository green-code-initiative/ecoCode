== Why is this an issue?

Turning on the torch mode programmatically with `react-native-torch` must absolutely be avoided because the flashlight is one of the most energy-intensive component.

== Non compliant Code Example

[source,js,data-diff-id="2",data-diff-type="noncompliant"]
----
import Torch from 'react-native-torch'; // Non-compliant
----

[source,js,data-diff-id="2",data-diff-type="compliant"]
----
import axios from 'axios'; // Compliant
