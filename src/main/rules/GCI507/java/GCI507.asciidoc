To avoid draining the battery, an Android device that is left idle quickly falls asleep. Hence, keeping the CPU on should be avoided, unless it is absolutely necessary.

If so, developers typically use a Power Manager system service feature called wake locks by invoking `PowerManager.WakeLock#newWakeLock(int levelAndFlags, String tag)`, along with the specific permission `WAKE_LOCK` in their manifest.

[source,java]
----
PowerManager pm = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
WakeLock manager = pm.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "TAG");
