Don't concatenate `strings` in loops, use a `StringBuilder` instead.

== Why is this an issue ?

`strings` are immutable so each time they are concatenated, a new one is created. When in a loop, this can lead to a waste of memory and CPU time.

In comparison, a `StringBuilder` works with a single mutable buffer, from which a resulting `string` can be allocated when needed.

=== When can it be ignored ?

If the number of concatenations is very small, typically 5 or less, then the overhead cost is either marginal or non-existent, and can be ignored.

== Non compliant example

[source, cs]
----
string myString = string.Empty;
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    myString += i; // Non compliant : this requires a new string allocation on each iteration
----

== Compliant example

[source, cs]
----
var builder = new StringBuilder(); // Creating the buffer itself requires an allocation
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    _ = builder.Append(i); // Update the buffer, no allocation required

string myString = builder.ToString(); // Triggers a string allocation, but only once
----
