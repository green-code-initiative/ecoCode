== The three sources of impacts of a code identified are:

- Energy: measured in joules (J)
- Transfer: measured in Bytes (B)
- Storage: measured in Bytes (B)

The control of these 3 impacts allows to lengthen the life of the terminals as well as reduce their energy consumption.

The _ETSdiff_ tool allows measuring a differential on these three values and in a given context (database and fixed measurement environment).

The results generated by _ETSdiff_ must help define the interest of the rule reported by _SonarQube_ in the context of the code analyzed.
