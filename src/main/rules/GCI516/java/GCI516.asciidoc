Creation of a Media Player object with `new MediaPlayer()` can be used to control playback of audio/video files and streams. Class own a`release()` method.

In addition to unnecessary resources (such as memory and instances of codecs) being held, failure to call this method immediately if a media object is no longer needed may also lead to continuous battery consumption for mobile devices.
