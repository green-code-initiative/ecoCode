== Why is this an issue?

CSS animations, especially complex or continuous animations, can impact the performance of a web page.
They may consume significant browser resources, leading to slower page rendering and decreased user experience, particularly on devices with limited processing power.

On mobile devices, constant animations can contribute to increased power consumption, affecting the device's battery life.
Limiting the usage of CSS animations helps in creating a more energy-efficient and mobile-friendly user experience.

It's important to note that while limiting animations is generally advisable for certain scenarios, there are cases where animations contribute positively to the user experience and overall design.
In this case they should be limited to the CSS properties `opacity` and `transform` with it's associated functions : `translate`, `rotate` and `scale`.
You can also inform the navigator of upcoming changes with the `will-change` instruction for more optimization.
