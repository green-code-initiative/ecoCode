Variable can be made constant.

## Why is this an issue ?

Unlike variables, constant values are known at compile time and are injected as is in the code, requiring no runtime processing and therefore reducing the environmental footprint.
Although good compilers will const eligible variables by themselves, it is still good practice to declare them constant, as it makes the code intent clearer.

### When can it be ignored ?

This rule should not be ignored.

## Non-compliant examples

```java
public void Ec82NonCompliant() {
        String test = "test"; // Non compliant, i is never reassigned and can be made constant
        System.out.println(test);
}
```
## Compliant examples

```java
final String test = "test";

public void Ec82Compliant()
{
    System.out.println(test);
}
```
