# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven and publish artifact to Maven Central (https://search.maven.org)
#
# After deploy to https://s01.oss.sonatype.org finished, manual steps is required :
# - Go to: https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
# - Check upload and if all is right, "Close" corresponding Staging Repository
# - "Release" corresponding Staging Repository
# - Wait some hours and then check availability of release on Maven central: https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.ecocode
