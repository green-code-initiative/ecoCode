<p><b>Use generator comprehension instead of list comprehension in for loop declaration.</b></p>
<p>Python generators resemble lazy lists from other programming languages: when iterated over, they compute their values on the fly. They lack some list behaviors (indexing, len method, ...) but are memory-efficient, as they do not store each of their values in memory, unlike lists. Thus, when declared in a for-loop declaration, list comprehensions can be safely replaced with generator comprehensions. </p>
<p>For more details on list comprehensions vs generator comprehensions, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#generator-expressions-and-list-comprehensions">Python documentation</a>.</p>
