| EC2      | Multiple if-else statements                                   | Using too many conditional if-else statements will impact performance since JVM will have to compare the conditions. Prefer using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else if possible, or refactor your code to reduce conditonnal statements on the same variable. Switch statement has a performance advantage over if – else.                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅    | ✅   | 🚀 | ✅      | 🚀   | 🚀 | 🚫   |
| EC3      | Getting the size of the collection in the loop                | When iterating over any collection, fetch the size of the collection in advance to avoid fetching it on each iteration, this saves CPU cycles, and therefore consumes less power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅    | ✅   | 🚀 | 🚫     | 🚀   | 🚫 | 🚫   |
| EC4      | Use global variables                                          | When using a global variable, the interpretation engine must check:  1) that it exists in the current scope, in the one above, etc. ; 2) the variable has a value; 3) ... To avoid all these checks, it is often possible to pass the useful variables as arguments of routines, making them local.  This process saves computational time (CPU cycles).                                                                     | [cnumr best practices (3rd edition) BP_050 (no longer exists in edition 4)](https://www.greenit.fr/2019/05/07/ecoconception-web-les-115-bonnes-pratiques-3eme-edition/) | 🚫   | ✅   | 🚀 | ✅      | 🚀   | 🚫 | 🚫   |

## Rules to be reworked / measured / clarified

This table lists rules proposed by the community but they have to be reworked / measured / clarified before being
implemented in ecoCode plugins.
(Issues and PR are closed, but they can be reopen once rework launched)
