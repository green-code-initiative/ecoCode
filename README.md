ecoCode is a collective project aiming at the reduction the environmental footprint of IT at the software level. The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to remove quality flaws in your codebase that may have an ecological impact: energy and resources consumption, "fatware", lifespan of terminals, etc.

ecoCode is based on evolving catalogs of [good practices](good_practices/), for various technologies. A SonarQube plugin then implement these catalogs as rules for scanning your projects.

**Warning**: this is still a very early stage project. Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated. Please refer to the contribution section.
