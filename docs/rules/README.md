## Rules

Web-oriented rules are based on :

(https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices)
- GR491, LE GUIDE DE RÉFÉRENCE DE CONCEPTION RESPONSABLE DE SERVICES NUMÉRIQUES (https://gr491.isit-europe.org/)
- Référentiel général d'écoconception de services numériques (RGESN) (https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-general-ecoconception/)

We try to apply these rules to each supported language, so we maintain a matrix to follow current development.
